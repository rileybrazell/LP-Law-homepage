                <h2>PECK-LAW STEPS UP</h2>
                <h4>for people whose rights have been denied in the places
                    that matter most to them — at work or in their community.</h4>

                    First, we listen and we evaluate your options. If we can
                    help – we will. We listen when others have not; we pay
                    attention when those who should, don’t. We step in and
                    then stand up with you in the face of often frustrating,
                    confusing, or frightening circumstances. We look at the big
                    picture while taking in the small details of your case to
                    find solutions that are right for you. Together, we will
                    help you decide your best path forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your peace of mind is paramount, and Peck-Law works to help
                    you fully understand your rights, consider your options,
                    make choices, and find confidence in whatever path you
                    choose.

                    everything she did for me and my family throughout this
